## Hi there 👋

<!--
**bytes50/bytes50** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a defi project for my end of the year presentation on what i learned the most about at home. i do have to make the project something my class could understand from a higher level overview
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain development with solidity on the ethereum network (don't assume i won't come for L2's!)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on defi projects with people in defi once i have the skills heh!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with studying, i can't seem to find the best way to teach myself
- 💬 Ask me about anything defi related, get me interested in what idk about yet
- 📫 How to reach me: i'm not really sure. i heard about lens and dune, maybe i'll join soon
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: i'm only in 8th grade, my dad kind of told me a little bit about decentralisation so now i'm trying to get ahead of everyone else lol
