## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**zoeybytes/zoeybytes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a defi project for my end of the year presentation on what i learned the most about at home. i do have to make the project something my class could understand from a higher level overview
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning blockchain development with solidity on the ethereum network (don't assume i won't come for L2's!)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on defi projects with people in defi once i have the skills heh!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with studying, i can't seem to find the best way to teach myself
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything defi related, get me interested in what idk about yet
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: i'm not really sure. i heard about lens and dune, maybe i'll join soon
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: im super cool and i may look like a noob but dont let it fool you
